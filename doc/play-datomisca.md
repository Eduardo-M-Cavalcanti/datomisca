# Play Datomisca

[Play Datomisca](https://github.com/pellucidanalytics/play-datomisca) is a module for [Play Framework](http://www.playframework.org) which allows using Datomisca in Play in a seamless way.

For now, it's quite raw not providing much more on top of Datomisca but more features should be added progressively to configure Datomic for ex.
